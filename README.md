# citation-bias

In recent years, there are publicly available publication search platforms like Google Scholar, PubMed and Web of Science. This allows researchers to quickly and accurately find relevant information, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the advancement of science. Those platforms provide basic functionality such as sorting and relevance ranking. A typical ranking algorithm leverages different features as relevance signals, i.e., textual relevance, authority, the number of citations, etc. However, there is an evidence that such a ranking algorithm may be subject to certain types of biases, e.g., popularity bias or gender bias. This could prevent certain researchers from receiving recognition for their works due to gendered disparities in citation rates and publishing opportunities.

In this project, I conducted an analysis of a DBLP Citation Network dataset from https://www.aminer.org/citation. The goal is to understand gender bias in author networks. First, I performed a large-scale data preprocessing step to clean missing data, such as, author names. Second, I developed a gender classification model to infer gender of the authors from their first names. This allows me to compute the gender and citation distribution over the dataset.
